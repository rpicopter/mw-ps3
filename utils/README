mw-ps3.sh is a script that automates pairing of PS3 controller and autostarts mw-ps3 controller.
It can be called in background on start of your system (i.e. from rc.local).


Other programs (not needed for PS3 but useful for bluetooth networking; can be called in background on startup):
- blueagent5.py
- bridge
- bt-pan


Using bluetooth5:
- ensure bluetoothd is started on boot
- ensure you have got dhcp server configured (for bt network)
- start blueagent5.py --pin 0000
- start bridge (for bt network)
- start bt-pan server pan0 (for bt network)

bridge:
	#!/bin/sh
	brctl addbr pan0 
	brctl setfd pan0 0
	brctl stp pan0 off
	ifconfig pan0 192.168.10.20 netmask 255.255.255.0
	ifconfig pan0 up
	udhcpd
