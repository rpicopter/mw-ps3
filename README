MultiWii PS3

For general information about this project see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rpicopter/mw-config/master/README

If you are using ps3 controller wirelessly you will need to install sixad and sixpair (QtSixA)
	(note: sixad might not be needed in the newer kernel versions as it has built in PS3 support)
	(note: you might need to add #include <unistd.h> into shared.h to compile sixad on raspbian itself)
	(note: for sixpair your might need to disable JACK support in Makefile)


Requirements
==============
- mw-service
- mw-config (for autostart)
- sixad and sixpair (for wireless operation)
- build tools (autotools, libtool, automake)

Installation
==============
- ./autogen.sh
- make & sudo make install

Running & Testing
==============
- if using mw-config this will be started automatically
Otherwise:
- for wireless operation run utils/mw-ps3.sh which should take care of everything (pairing and starting)
- otherwise just run ./mw-ps3 once your PS3 is connected


Usage:
- left stick - throttle/yaw (throttle behaves incrementally)
- right stick - roll/pitch
- button o - toggle BOXHORIZON
- button x - toggle BOXBARO
