If you are using ps3 controller wirelessly you will need to install sixad and sixpair (QtSixA)
	(note: sixad might not be needed in the newer kernel versions as it has built in PS3 support)
	(note: you might need to add #include <unistd.h> into shared.h to compile sixad on raspbian itself)
	(note: for sixpair your might need to disable JACK support in Makefile)

Compile:
- ./autogen.sh
- make
- sudo make install
- Opionally copy utils/mw-ps3.sh to your system and call it every boot in the background (i.e. in rc.local). See utils/README for more details

Run:
- utils/mw-ps3.sh should take care of everything (pairing and starting)
- otherwise just run ./mw-ps3 once your PS3 is connected


Usage:
- left stick - throttle/yaw (throttle behaves incrementally)
- right stick - roll/pitch
- button o - toggle BOXHORIZON
- button x - toggle BOXBARO
